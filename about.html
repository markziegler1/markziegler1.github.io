          I specialize in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python, and I'm

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into software development started during my college years,
          where I discovered a passion for coding and problem-solving. Since
          then, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small
          business websites to large-scale web applications.
        </p>

          Over the years, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with talented
          teams and work on exciting projects that have challenged me to grow as
          a developer. Each project has been a learning experience, and I'm
          always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of
          what's possible.
